# Advent of Code 2022!

I'll be test-driving solutions for the [Advent of Code (2022)](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in TypeScript as this is my focus currently.

The aim is to practice TDD in TypeScript, solve the puzzles, and practice syntax of other languages by translation when time allows.

## Dec-03

- I'm starting today, so catching up first, test-drive day01 in TypeScript
