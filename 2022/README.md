# Advent of Code 2022!

I'll be test-driving solutions for the [Advent of Code (2022)](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in TypeScript as this is my focus currently.

The aim is to practice TDD in TypeScript, solve the puzzles, and practice syntax of other languages by translation when time allows.

## Dec-03

- I'm starting today, so catching up first, test-drive solutions in TypeScript
- The first three days are completed
- No rush at all, TDD and learning TypeScript instead of going for speed
- My internet connection dropped, and it looks like it might have caused a bug, or maybe the the third line wasn't supposed to be fully revealed after the sixth star
