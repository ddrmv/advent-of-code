# Advent of Code 2022!

I'll be test-driving solutions for the [Advent of Code (2022)](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in TypeScript as this is my focus currently.

The aim is to practice TDD in TypeScript, solve the puzzles, and practice syntax of other languages by translation when time allows. So, all scores will be 0.

```

## Dec-03

- I'm starting today, so catching up first, test-drive solutions in TypeScript
- The first three days are completed
- No rush at all, TDD and learning TypeScript instead of going for speed

## Dec-04

- Some refactoring at the end to pass differentiator functions between part 1 and 2 as a parameter, together with the use of a Range interface
