# Advent of Code 2022!

I'll be test-driving solutions for the [Advent of Code (2022)](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in TypeScript as this is my focus currently.

The aim is to practice TDD in TypeScript, solve the puzzles, and practice syntax of other languages by translation when time allows. So, all scores will be 0.

### Dec-03

- I'm starting today, so catching up first, test-drive solutions in TypeScript
- The first three days are completed
- No rush at all, TDD and learning TypeScript instead of going for speed

### Dec-04

- Some refactoring at the end to pass differentiator functions between part 1 and 2 as a parameter, together with the use of a Range interface

### Dec-05

- First time used a class in any of the puzzles. Went well together with a few interfaces
- First time my check-for-solution final test didn't give the correct answer on the first run, destructuring an array fixed it for the second try
- It very unexpected and even difficult to believe the first nine stars were right on the first attempt - test-driving is wonderful

### Dec-06

- Easier than the day before

### Dec-11

- Day 7 took too long, so it has been left for a later date
- Rewriting day 1 in Python and Pytest
